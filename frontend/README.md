# ULTSPY Web UI

This web interface allows operators to interact with the ULTSPY C2 backend.
It is built with Vite, React and TypeScript.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server proxies API requests to `http://localhost:5000`.
Store your API key after logging in; requests include it via the `X-API-KEY` header.
